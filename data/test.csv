1457,if you have dated a man for years and he has consistantly told you that he was not married what do you do/? i dated a man for about 2 years. several times i asked him if he was married and each time the answer was no. i believed it because he was always with me, day and night if that's what i wanted. we even discussed getting married. i invested alot of feeling into this guy and i thought that we had something real. because we work at the same place, i over heard some people say that he was married. i most recently found out by getting a background check that he is in fact married. he says that he is going to file for a divorce and then he and i can get married. i'm sorry but i just don't have the faith in him that i once had and it has become so hard for me to trust any thing that he says to me. i am now feeling so insulted that he took the choice of wanting to be involved in that type of situation away from me. as if i am a child and can not make my own choices. there is time there and i cre for him. what do you all think that i should do about this situation and why? help me out please...
